Distest
=======

Distest makes it easy to write application tests for discord bots.

Distest uses a secondary bot to send commands to your bot and ensure that it responds as expected.

See the :ref:`interface <interface>` reference for a list of assertions this library is capable of.

.. note::
    Two quick note about recent changes:

      1. You NEED to enable the ``members`` intent on the tester bot. For more information, see :ref:`Member Intent <member_intent>`
      2. If you're using the :py:class:`ext.commands.Bot <discord.ext.commands.Bot>` system, you will need to patch your ``Bot`` to allow it to listen to other discord bots, as usually commands ignore other bots. This is really easy, we provide the patching function, just take a look at the :ref:`patching <patches>` documentation page.
